This is Conway's Game of Life made with ES6 for Firefox.

This was a personal project I made a while ago, in Febuary or March of 2015.  
It was something quick I did to try out new Ecmascript 6 features that had been implemented in Firefox.
I found it, and seeing as how I am trying to catalog all my projects and experiences, I figured I would upload it github.  I made a few modifications before uploading, all of them UI.  
I added some text telling info like if it was running, what draw mode you were in, and how to change the drawmode.  But, other then that, I don't feel like revamping an old project like this, I would rather remake it from scratch.

At the time of writing, this only works on Firefox, and I have only tested on Firefox Developer Edition of 37 and above.  I make no promises about compatability with any other browser or version.
